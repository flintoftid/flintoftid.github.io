    <p>In the paper ”A new conformal FDTD for lossy thin panels” by M. R. Cabello et al., the appearance of spiky anti-resonances in the simulation of the shielding properties of lossy thin-shell spherical cavities by FDTD, was categorised as spurious solutions. In this document, we briefly clarify this topic, and show that these solutions are not really spurious in the common interpretation of the term. Actually, they correspond to physical solutions, appearing due to lack of symmetry inherent to the staggered co-location nature of field components in FDTD.</p>

  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>We take a first look at hard Single Event Effects (SEE) in power electronics and SRAMS during extreme Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events. We show that there is significant risk of failure of silicon power MOSFETs and IGBTs at ground level during a 10x Feb ’56 GLE. Were if the devices are not de-rated we find that 21% of power MOSFETs and 14% of IGBTs are, in the worst case, predicted to fail. The failure rate increases to 68% and 52% during a once in a 10,000-year GLE for power MOSFETs and IGBTs respectively. Silicon Carbide devices show a lower failure rate by more than an order of magnitude, where only 2.8% are predicted to fail during a once in a 10,000-year GLE. It is clear that these events could disrupt critical infrastructure if mitigating precautions are not implemented.</p>

    <p>The human body absorption cross section (ACS) is important in nonionizing radiation dosimetry, but it is always hard to accurately evaluate the ACS of an individual from his or her morphological parameters, such as height and weight. To obtain an empirical formula that can evaluate the ACS from morphological parameters, 48 subjects with different morphological parameters were measured from 1 to 16 GHz in a reverberation chamber. The ACS was extracted from the power delay profile. This has the advantage of not requiring antenna radiation efficiency, and it has not been previously used in a wideband group study like this. The accuracy of the ACS measurement is demonstrated by comparison with the ACS of a spherical model with known structure and material, and the mean absolute percentage error of the sphere measurement is just 3.4%. Statistical analysis shows that the body surface area (BSA) has the strongest correlation with the ACS among all the morphological parameters; therefore, we present a new empirical ACS formula as a function of BSA and frequency. This will be of interest to those considering dosimetry, and in computing the effect of human body absorption on radio propagation in vehicles and other structures.</p>

    <p>In this study, a reverberation chamber is used to perform measurements of shielding effectiveness (SE) and average total radiated power (ATRP) related to a domestic microwave oven for human exposure purposes. The ATRP is measured according to Annex E in the standard IEC 61000-4-21 procedure, and a new nondestructive procedure is proposed to measure SE that relies on the internal source of the microwave oven and on the reverberation chamber. Under mild hypothesis, the nondestructive procedure is both theoretically and experimentally equivalent to the IEEE 299.1 one. In addition, the measured ATRP values are within the limits defined in EN 62233.</p>

    <p>The power balance technique for the prediction of shielding effectiveness of reverberant enclosures is fast and simple to use. However, it assumes a uniform field in the enclosure, which has been shown to be incorrect in the presence of dissipative contents. The diffusion model is a generalization of the power balance method that can account for the field inhomogeneity due the presence of losses with much lower computational effort than a full-wave solver. Evaluation of a two-dimensional diffusion model produced promising results compared to physical measurements. Here, we present a three-dimensional (3-D) diffusion model applied to an enclosure with an aperture and dissipative contents. Com16 parisons between the 3-D diffusion model, measurements, and a full-wave solver suggest that it is able to account for the variation of the electromagnetic field due to dissipative contents with far less computational effort than full-wave solvers. The diffusion model allows rapid solution of the shielding effectiveness of enclosures with dissipative contents and arbitrary geometries and reduces the time to model equipment enclosures from hours to minutes, while still determining the variation of field strength due to contents. In addition, the method may help predict field inhomogeneity in reverberation chambers.</p>

    <p>Determination of the rate of energy loss in a reverberation chamber is fundamental to many different measurements such as absorption cross section, antenna efficiency, radiated power, and shielding effectiveness. Determination of the energy decay time constant in the time domain by linear fitting the power delay profile, rather than using the frequency-domain quality-factor, has the advantage of being independent of the radiation efficiency of antennas used in the measurement. However, determination of chamber time constant by linear regression suffers from several practical problems, including a requirement for long measurement times. Here, we present a new nonlinear curve fitting technique that can extract the time constant with typically 60% fewer samples of the chamber transfer function for the same measurement uncertainty, which enables faster measurement of chamber time constant by sampling fewer chamber transfer function, and allows for more robust automated data postprocessing. Nonlinear curve fitting could have economic benefits for test houses, and also enables accurate broadband measurements on humans in about 10 min for microwave exposure and medical applications. The accuracy of the nonlinear method is demonstrated by measuring the absorption cross section of several test objects of known properties. The measurement uncertainty of the method is verified using Monte Carlo methods.</p>

    <p>The electromagnetic environment inside a shielding enclosure is affected by the absorption characteristics of the contents, which should therefore be represented in shielding measurements and simulations. At frequencies up to a few gigahertz, lossy dielectric materials have previously been used as surrogates for printed circuit boards in enclosure shielding assessment, both experimentally and in simulations. However, no systematic methodology for the design of these surrogates and their calibration against real hardware at high frequencies has been elucidated. In this paper we show how both lossy dielectric material and microstrip transmission line based “representative contents” can be designed and calibrated against real printed circuit boards over the frequency range 2-20 GHz using power balance concepts. The calibration is made by matching the average absorption cross-section of the surrogate to an average value for a class of real contents measured in a reverberation chamber. The surrogates are designed using efficient power balance models for layered media and field-excited microstrip lines and verified using full-wave simulation. The fabricated surrogates are validated by shielding measurements. The methodology presented could form an important part of future standards for enclosure qualification measurements that more accurately represent the internal environment of real equipment.</p>

    <p>Thin sheet models are essential to allow shielding effectiveness of composite enclosures and vehicles to be modelled. Thin dispersive sheets are often modeled using surface
impedance models in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) codes in order to deal efficiently with the multi-scale nature of the overall structure. Such boundary conditions must be applied to collocated tangential electric and magnetic fields on either side of the surface; this is usually done on the edges of the FDTD mesh cells at the electric field sampling points. However, these edge based schemes are difficult to implement accurately on staircased surfaces. Here we present a novel face centered approach to the collocation of the fields for the application of the boundary condition. This approach naturally deals with the ambiguities in the surface normal that arise at the edges on stair-cased surfaces, allowing a simpler implementation. The accuracy of the new scheme is compared to edge based and conformal approaches using both planar sheet and spherical shell canonical test cases. Stair-casing effects are quantified and the new face-centered scheme is shown have up to 3 dB lower error than the edge based approach in the cases considered, without the complexity and computational cost of conformal techniques.</p>

    <p>Determination of the distribution of electromagnetic energy inside electrically large enclosed spaces is important in many electromagnetic compatibility applications, such as certification of aircraft and equipment shielding enclosures. The field inside such enclosed environments contains a dominant diffuse component due to multiple randomizing reflections from the enclosing surfaces. The power balance technique has been widely applied to the analysis of such problems; however, it is unable to account for the inhomogeneities in the field that arise when the absorption in the walls and contents of the enclosure is significant. In this paper we show how a diffusion equation approach can be applied to modeling diffuse electromagnetic fields and evaluate its potential for use in electromagnetic compatibility applications. Two canonical examples were investigated: A loaded cavity and two cavities coupled by a large aperture. The predictions of the diffusion model were compared to measurement data and found to be in good agreement. The diffusion model has a very low computational cost compared to other applicable techniques, such as full-wave simulation and ray-tracing, offering the potential for a radical increase in the efficiency of the solution high frequency electromagnetic shielding problems with complex topologies.</p>

    <p>The inclusion of thin lossy, material layers, such as carbon based composites, is essential for many practical applications modeling the propagation of electromagnetic energy through composite structures such as those found in vehicles and electronic equipment enclosures. Many existing schemes suffer problems of late time instability, inaccuracy at low frequency, and/or large computational costs. This work presents a novel technique for the modeling of thin-layer lossy materials in FDTD schemes which overcomes the instability problem at low computational cost. For this, a 1D-subgrid is used for the spatial discretization of the thin layer material. To overcome the additional time-step constraint posed by the reduction in the spatial cell size, a Crank-Nicolson time-integration scheme is used locally in the subgridded zone, and hybridized with the usual 3D Yee-FDTD method, which is used for the rest of the computational domain. Several numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy of this approach are shown and discussed. Results comparing the proposed technique with classical alternatives based on impedance boundary condition approaches are also presented. The new technique is shown to have better accuracy at low frequencies, and late time stability than existing techniques with low computational cost.</p>

    <p>Computational solvers are increasingly used to solve complex electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems in research, product design, and manufacturing. The reliability of these simulation tools must be demonstrated in order to give confidence in their results. Standards prescribe a range of techniques for the validation, verification, and calibration of computational electromagnetics solvers including external references based on measurement or for cross-validation with other models. We have developed a modular test-suite based on an enclosure to provide the EMC community with a complex external reference for model validation. We show how the test-suite can be used to validate a range of electromagnetic solvers. The emphasis of the test-suite is on the features of interest for EMC applications, such as apertures and coupling to cables. We have fabricated a hardware implementation of many of the test-cases and measured them in an anechoic chamber over the frequency range to 1–6 GHz to provide a measurement reference for validation over this range. The test-suite has already been used extensively in two major aeronautical research programs and is openly available for use and future development by the community.</p>

    <p>Nonwoven carbon-fiber sheets are often used to form a conductive layer in composite materials for electromagnetic shielding and other purposes. While a large amount of research has considered the properties of similar idealized materials near the percolation threshold, little has been done to provide validated analytic models suitable for materials of practical use for electromagnetic shielding. Since numerical models consume considerable computer resource and do not provide the insight which enables improved material design, an analytic model is of great utility for materials development. This paper introduces a new theoretical model for the sheet conductance of nonwoven carbon-fiber sheets built on the theory of percolation for 2-D conducting stick networks. The model accounts for the effects of sample thickness, fiber angle distribution, and contact conductance on the sheet conductance. The theory shows good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations and measurements of real materials in the supercritical percolation regime where the dimensionless areal concentration of fibers exceeds about 50. The theoretical model allows the rapid prediction of material shielding performance from a limited number of manufacturing parameters.</p>

    <p>Average ACS can be measured in a reverberation chamber; however, the existing technique determines a value that includes the effects of the radiation efficiencies of the antennas used in the measurement. Correcting for these necessitates further complex measurements. Here, we present the theory of an alternative measurement methodology using two nested or contiguous reverberation chambers which is free from errors caused by the radiation efficiencies of the antennas. The new method is based on the theoretical average transmission cross sections (TCS) of circular holes in a metal plate between the two chambers. In fact, the method can be viewed as an accurate transfer calibration measurement between TCS and ACS that is independent of both the chamber and antenna characteristics. Further, since the existing method of measuring ACS includes the effects of the radiation efficiencies of the antennas, a comparison of the ACS of a reference object, measured using both the existing and new methods, also provides an alternative method of determining radiation antenna efficiency. Measurement uncertainties for both alternative measurement methods-ACS and antenna radiation efficiency-are also derived.</p>

    <p>The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a numerical technique that is widely used to solve Maxwell’s differential equations in the time domain [1]. Both space and time are discretized. Space is discretized into rectangular-shaped elements in two-dimensional (2-D) or cuboid elements in three-dimensional (3-D). Cuboid elements, where the electric fields are located on the edges of the cuboid and the magnetic fields are normal to the faces, are called Yee cells and are the fundamental elements of most FDTD methods [2]. By filling up the problem space with these cells, we obtain a 3-D mesh, where neighboring cells share edges and faces. Each cell has three associated electric and magnetic field components, while the other field components belong to adjacent cells. The properties of each cell are adjusted to represent materials such as dielectrics or conductors by adjusting the constitutive parameters used in the field equations in the corresponding cells, hence forming the geometrical structure of the problem to be solved. For example, Figure 1 shows a sphere and a version of the sphere discretized using cubic elements.</p>

    <p>Absorption by the contents of an equipment enclosure, particularly printed circuit boards (PCBs), affect the enclosure’s shielding performance. At high frequencies, this absorption can be quantified using the angle of arrival and polarization averaged absorption cross-section (ACS). However, there is no available data on the high-frequency absorption characteristics of modern PCBs. In this study, we apply a reverberation chamber to the determination of the average ACS of a large number of PCBs taken from contemporary information and communication technology (ICT) equipment to provide a unique and comprehensive dataset. The ACS was found to range from 4 × 10-4-10-2 m2 from 2-20 GHz and different classes of PCB could be identified according to their surface characteristics. The “shadowing effect” of densely packed PCBs was also quantified for a subset of the PCBs. It was found that the ACS of a PCB in the stack was reduced by 20%-40% compared to its value when isolated. By way of a review of the general power balance analysis of an electrically large populated equipment enclosure in an external environment, we show how the acquired data will be useful for future qualification methodologies for ICT enclosures and PCBs.</p>

    <p>This paper reports the results of two experimental campaigns aimed at studying the high-frequency response of a raceway containing low voltage power, telephone, and Ethernet cables, to external electromagnetic field illumination. The raceway was tested against HPEM transients inside a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic (GTEM) cell and low-power fields inside a reverberation chamber (RC). The high-power electromagnetic (HPEM) tests revealed that the low-voltage power cables have the greatest coupling under a hyperband illumination, compared to telephone and Ethernet cables. The RC tests allowed the determination of statistical transfer functions from random incident field configurations into DM voltage in cable loads. The responses were found to be governed by the raceway under test at the lower frequencies (below 1 GHz). Between 0.2 and 1 GHz, the raceway gives about 10 dB higher coupling than a short patch cable. The difference is even greater at lower frequencies and for shielded cables. In the frequency band 1-3 GHz, little difference was observed between short patch cables and the full raceway, but both were still significantly higher than direct coupling to the measurement card. Beyond 3 GHz, the coupling is clearly dominated by the terminal equipment. The experiments performed in this paper provide a better understanding of the expected induced voltages and currents in commercial cable systems when exposed to intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI)-like signals.</p>

    <p>Average absorption cross section can be measured in a reverberation chamber with an uncertainty estimated from the number of independent samples of the chamber transfer function taken during the measurement. However, the current uncertainty model does not account the loading effect of the object being measured or the presence of nonstochastic energy in the chamber, as characterized by the Rician K-factor. Here, the uncertainty model for the absorption cross-section measurements has been extended to include both of these effects for the case of stepped mechanical tuning with a paddle and frequency tuning. The extended uncertainty formula has been applied to predict the range over which absorption cross-section measurements can be made with a defined relative uncertainty in a chamber of given geometry, using both simple models for the reverberation chamber and the measured quality-factor and K-factor. The model has been validated using measurements on a set of absorbing cubes of different sizes compared to Mie Series calculation on sphere of equivalent surface area. The extended error model is particularly utile for the design of reverberation chambers and experiments for absorption cross-section measurements across a wide range of application areas.</p>

    <p>A measurement methodology for polarisation and angle of incidence averaged electromagnetic absorption cross-section using a reverberation chamber is presented. The method is optimised for simultaneous rapid and accurate determination of average absorption cross-section over the frequency range 1 to 15 GHz, making it suitable for use in human absorption and exposure studies. The typical measurement time of the subject is about eight minutes with a corresponding statistical uncertainty of about 3% in the measured absorption cross-section. The method is validated by comparing measurements on a spherical phantom with Mie Series calculations. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with measurements of the posture dependence of the absorption cross-section of a human subject and an investigation of the effects of clothing on the measured absorption which are important considerations for the practical design of experiments for studies on human subjects.</p>

    <p>The electromagnetic absorption cross-section (ACS) averaged over polarization and angle-of-incidence of 60 ungrounded adult subjects was measured at microwave frequencies of 1–12 GHz in a reverberation chamber. Average ACS is important in non-ionizing dosimetry and exposure studies, and is closely related to the whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (WBSAR). The average ACS was measured with a statistical uncertainty of less than 3% and high frequency resolution for individuals with a range of body shapes and sizes allowing the statistical distribution of WBSAR over a real population with individual internal and external morphologies to be determined. The average ACS of all subjects was found to vary from 0.15 to 0.4 m 2 ; for an individual subject it falls with frequency over 1–6 GHz, and then rises slowly over the 6–12 GHz range in which few other studies have been conducted. Average ACS and WBSAR are then used as a surrogate for worst-case ACS/WBSAR, in order to study their variability across a real population compared to literature results from simulations using numerical phantoms with a limited range of anatomies. Correlations with body morphological parameters such as height, mass and waist circumference have been investigated: the strongest correlation is with body surface area (BSA) at all frequencies above 1 GHz, however direct proportionality to BSA is not established until above 5 GHz. When the average ACS is normalized to the BSA, the resulting absorption efficiency shows a negative correlation with the estimated thickness of subcutaneous body fat. Surrogate models and statistical analysis of the measurement data are presented and compared to similar models from the literature. The overall dispersion of measured average WBSAR of the sample of the UK population studied is consistent with the dispersion of simulated worst-case WBSAR across multiple numerical phantom families. The statistical results obtained allow the calibration of human exposure assessments made with particular phantoms to a population with a range of individual morphologies.</p>

    <p>This paper reports on the outcomes of the project “Electromagnetic Monitoring of Semiconductor Ageing” funded through the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Through-life Engineering Services. The basis of the feasibility study reported in this paper is that all active devices exhibit non-linear behaviour and the behaviour of those devices will change as they age. As a result, the radiation or re-radiation of intermodulation products will change as the device ages. The goal of the project is to verify that this change in non-linear behaviour could be identified in a way that does not require modification of existing circuitry, thus allowing through-life and non-destructive monitoring of devices for signs of early deterioration. Results obtained from this work have been very encouraging and have set the scene for further development of the techniques to include degradation fingerprinting and system health monitoring.</p>

    <p>We present broadband reverberation chamber measurements of the absorption
	cross section (ACS) of the human body averaged over all directions
	of incidence and angles of polarization. This frequency-dependent
	parameter characterizes the interactions between the body and the
	enclosures of reverberant environments such as aircraft cabins, and
	is, therefore, important for the determination of the overall Q-factor
	and, hence, the field strength illuminating equipment inside such
	enclosures. It also correlates directly with the electromagnetic
	exposure of occupants of reverberant environments. The average ACS
	of nine subjects was measured at frequencies over the range 1–8.5
	GHz. For a 75-kg male, the ACS varied between 0.18 and 0.45 square
	meters over this range. ACS also correlated with body surface area
	for the subjects tested. The results agree well with computational
	electromagnetic simulations, but are obtained much more rapidly.
	We have used the obtained values of ACS to estimate the effect of
	passengers on the Q-factor of a typical airliner cabin.</p>

    <p>The statistical distributions of the reradiated spectrum from an ensemble of nonlinear devices subjected to radio-frequency interference measured in a reverberation chamber are investigated. This phenomenon can be used to probe the interaction between threatening radio-frequency energy and digital hardware. Previously, a statistical model was developed to explain the statistics of the measured spectrum from a single nonlinear element. Here, the model is extended to the more realistic situation with multiple reradiating sources. It is observed in the measurement results that two parameters, the power level of the interference and the spatial distribution of the reradiating sources, have effects on the statistical distribution. It is shown that the Monte Carlo simulations based on the statistical models can properly reconstruct the measured statistical distributions. Understanding the signature of the onset of hard nonlinearity in the observed spectrum may lead to the development of an immunity diagnostic tool that does not depend on monitoring the functional behavior of the equipment-under-test.</p>

    <p>The dielectric properties of biological tissues at radio and microwave frequencies are strongly correlated with tissue water content. Localized, in vivo measurement of permittivity and conductivity should therefore provide useful clinical information in diseases involving abnormal hydration, such as lymphoedema. We have developed an open-geometry sensor for segmental hydration studies based on a flat cavity resonator operating at 300 MHz, and have demonstrated that the changes in its resonant frequency and Q -factor were significantly greater when it was applied to a swollen, oedematous finger, compared to an uninjured finger of similar size. The resonant sensor was calibrated with reference liquids in vials inserted through holes in its cavity plates, and we found that a modified resonant cavity perturbation formula, with coefficients empirically optimized by means of a genetic algorithm, yielded good agreement with literature values of complex permittivity. However, extending the length of the sample containers leads to measurement artefacts owing to antenna currents with associated radiated energy losses. A detailed simulation of the system with a full-wave solver using Method-of-Moments enabled us to estimate the current distribution and energy balance, and thus take steps towards mitigating these effects and enabling the system to make quantitative in vivo measurements of tissue dielectric properties.</p>

    <p>A method is presented for the measurement of shielding effectiveness of planar materials with nonconducting surfaces such as carbon fiber composites. The method overcomes edge termination problems with such materials by absorbing edge-diffracted energy. A dynamic range of up to 100 dB has been demonstrated over a frequency range of 1-8.5 GHz, depending on the size of the sample under test. Comparison with ASTM D4935 and nested reverberation measurements of shielding effectiveness shows good agreement.</p>

    <p>A novel indirect measurement technique is developed in which the input impedance of an unknown antenna structure is determined by measuring the change in the measured input impedance of a second probe antenna, while the unknown antenna is loaded at its input by a set of known impedances. The feasibility of the approach is explored using method-of-moment boundary element simulations of the interaction between two dipole antennas in free space. Examples of the measurement of the helical antenna of a terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) handheld radio and a small portable device with an electrically small antenna are presented. The significant advantage of the technique in the accurate measurement of electrically small antennas is confirmed.</p>

    <p>The emission spectrum of digital hardware under the influence of external electromagnetic interference is shown to contain information about the interaction of the incident energy with the digital circuits in the system. The generation mechanism of the re-emission spectrum is reviewed, describing how nonlinear effects may be a precursor to the failure of the equipment under test. Measurements on a simple circuit are used to demonstrate how the characteristics of the re-emission spectrum may be correlated with changes to the digital waveform within the circuit. The technique is also applied to a piece of complex digital hardware where similar, though more subtle, effects can be measured. It is shown that the re-emission spectrum can be used to detect the interaction of the interference with the digital devices at a level well below that which is able to cause static failures in the circuits. The utility of the technique as a diagnostic tool for immunity testing of digital hardware, by identifying which subsystems are being affected by external interference, is also demonstrated.</p>

    <p>A simple model has been developed to characterize electromagnetic interference induced timing variations (jitter) in digital circuits. The model is based on measurable switching parameters of logic gates, and requires no knowledge of the internal workings of a device. It correctly predicts not only the dependence of jitter on the amplitude, modulation depth and frequency of the interfering signal, but also its statistical distribution. The model has been used to calculate the immunity level and bit error rate of a synchronous digital circuit subjected to radio frequency interference, and to compare the electromagnetic compatibility performance of fast and slow logic devices in such a circuit.</p>

    <p>Intermediate-level circuit models use circuit models containing transmission lines to represent the waveguide modes in an enclosure. The coupling of electromagnetic fields to contents, and apertures is achieved by the use of circuit approximations. Typical models run in a few seconds on a personal computer, compared with many hours, or even days, required for full-wave simulations of the same problem. This efficiency allows the intermediate-level models to be used in situations where the time and effort involved in full-wave simulations would be prohibitive. The technique is reviewed, discussing both its relation to full-wave simulations and the type of problems for which it is a particularly appropriate tool. Example applications to the prediction of the immunity of a generic missile (GENEC) are given, based on extensions of the model to enclosures with a circular cross-section. The models have been validated by measurements on GENEC and comparison with other simulation techniques. A coupling model has also been developed for small apertures in the sidewall of the waveguide using aperture polarisability theory. The results demonstrate that excellent agreement with measurements can be obtained at frequencies up to 3 GHz.</p>

    <p>As the density of transmitters from mobile telecommunication systems continues to increase there is a greater risk of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems due to the ensemble electromagnetic field from multiple mobile handsets. An analysis of the characteristics of the threat field from multiple handsets is presented allowing prediction of the statistics of the ensemble field. A measurement system designed to detect electromagnetic interference (EMI) from ensembles of cellular phones has been used to quantify the level of EMI on Ethernet cables from multiple global system for mobile communications (GSM) mobiles. The measurements are consistent with a simple statistical model of ensemble signals from GSM sources and electromagnetic modeling of the system.</p>

    <p>The properties of giant colour flux tubes-colour ropes-are investigated using the colour-dielectric model. Such ropes may be responsible for quark-gluon plasma formation during ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The phenomenological parameters in the model are determined by fitting a simple one-flavour nucleon model to experimental data. The string tension radius and chromoelectric field have been calculated as a function of the colour charge on the rope. The pair creation rate and transverse momentum distribution for quarks created in ropes by the Schwinger mechanism are also calculated.</p>

    <p>This paper presents some thoughts on the meaning of shielding effectiveness (SE) for a real enclosure. It is demonstrated that the conventional measurement of SE is a value specific to the particular measurement and is not necessarily representative of the enclosure in any practical situation, including a different measurement. The SE of an enclosure depends both on the enclosure contents, including the measurement antenna and the effective transmission cross section of the energy coupling mechanisms such as apertures, penetrations, seams and diffusion through walls.</p>

    <p>A new broad-band antenna structure specifically designed for antenna position stirring in a reverberation chamber is described. The antenna features a reactive rotating source coupler that overcomes the problems of cable and connector reliability and stability often encountered in antenna source stirring due to cable movement. The stirring performance of the new antenna is evaluated by observation of the reduction in Rician K-factor facilitated by the antenna.</p>

    <p>In reverberant electromagnetic environments such as reverberation chambers, shielding enclosures, vehicles and buildings, the electromagnetic energy density is often assumed to be uniform and the direction of arrival of electromagnetic waves (Poynting vector) and their polarisation is assumed uniformly distributed. This is the basis of the power balance method for electromagnetic coupling analysis and much of the theory of reverberation chambers. However significant field inhomogeneity is often encountered in practice when significant losses are present. In this paper we show why this must be so when an energy flow exists from the source of energy to absorptive elements, and how the non-uniformity can be determined using a diffusion based solution. The diffusion based solution, though not as computationally efficient as the power balance method, is still much more efficient than a full-wave approach.</p>

    <p>Absorption cross section (ACS) of an object is used in stochastic power balance models, while human ACS is closely related to microwave dosimetry parameters such as specific absorption rate (SAR) and thus characterises exposure as well as effect of human bodies on multipath propagation. ACS, averaged over all directions of incidence, can be obtained in the frequency domain from the S-parameters of two antennas in a stirred-mode reverberation chamber; however, our new time domain method is faster, avoids the need to determine antenna efficiency, and has been validated with a test object of calculable ACS. We can now measure human ACS from 1 to 18GHz, to within 3%, in under 10 minutes. We have done this for 48 subjects, and explored correlations between ACS and body parameters including mass, height, surface area and subcutaneous fat thickness.</p>

    <p>Diffusion equation based modeling has been proposed for mapping the reverberant component of the electromagnetic field in enclosures at high frequencies. Preliminary evaluation of the electromagnetic diffusion model using a dimensional reduction approach showed promising results compared to measurements. Here we develop a full three-dimensional diffusion model of the experimental canonical test cases considered in the preliminary evaluation and obtain finite element method solutions. The results are compared to those of the two-dimensional models. We find that the two and three dimensional models are generally in excellent agreement for the pseudo two-dimensional test-cases considered. Some deviations between the two- and three-dimensional models are observed due to the fact the point source must be effectively represented by a line source in the reduced model. The three-dimensional model is still highly efficient compared to other applicable techniques, offering the prospect of a radical reduction in the resources required for simulating reverberant fields in electrically large structures.</p>

The errors in SE are found to be associated with the error in the surface area of the cavity caused by the use of a stair-cased mesh. An empirical solution is demonstrated, which improves the stair-cased model accuracy to be comparable to that achievable by a conformal model. Errors in the resonant frequencies ,Q factors and field minima of a cavity, due to the stair-cased mesh, are also noted.</p>

    <p>The Absorption Cross Section (ACS) of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) can be used to help determine how PCBs affect the internal electromagnetic (EM) field in a shielded enclosure and thus the enclosure shielding effectiveness. Stacked PCBs inside densely populated enclosures may not have the same ACS as the sum of the individual PCBs due to ‘shadowing’ effects. In this paper ACS measurement results from stacked PCBs are presented. The results show that stacking the PCBs close together reduces the ACS and this effect is increased with a greater number of PCBs.</p>

    <p>The electromagnetic environment inside an equipment enclosure at high frequencies is strongly dependent on the absorption of energy by the contents. This effect is neglected by current shielding measurement standards. Here we extended the concept of shielding measurements using surrogate “representative contents” proposed at lower frequencies into the regime were the enclosure is electrically large. We demonstrate how a surrogate fabricated from radio absorbing material can be made to give the same overall absorption as a real printed circuit board and hence produce the same internal environment inside an enclosure during a shielding measurement.</p>

    <p>Knowledge of the absorption cross section (ACS) of a printed circuit board (PCB) is essential when defining an enclosure’s shielding effectiveness as it will determine how a PCB affects the internal electromagnetic (EM) field inside the enclosure. In this paper we show how the ACS changes when a PCB is in the vicinity of the enclosure walls by making measurements in a small reverberation chamber. We find that when the PCB is perpendicular to the chamber wall different measurement positions have little effect on the ACS, even when the PCB is positioned close to the wall. However, placing the PCB parallel to the chamber wall did show some differences in ACS. This information could be useful when considering situations where PCBS are stacked together or close to enclosure walls when in a reverberant environment.</p>

    <p>Shielding effectiveness (SE) is an important measure of how well an enclosure reduces the electromagnetic (EM) field incident upon it. Commonly, when the shielding effectiveness of an enclosure is stated it is for the case when the enclosure is empty. Including contents such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) in the enclosure will affect the shielding effectiveness as the PCB absorbs EM energy. One technique of determining how much energy a PCB absorbs is to measure its absorption cross section (ACS) using a reverberation chamber (RC). The measured ACS can be used to predict the shielding effectiveness of an enclosure when the PCB is inside it using power balance techniques. In this paper the ACS of a number of PCBs are measured both individually and in closely stacked groups. This information is then used to show how the ACS can be used to calculate shielding effectiveness and the results are compared to direct measurement of the SE of the enclosure containing a PCB. Knowledge of the ACS of typical or particular PCBs could be used by engineers to estimate the real shielding effectiveness of an enclosure with contents, when designing electronic systems.</p>

    <p>The averaged absorption cross section (ACS) of a lossy object characterises its ability to capture power from diffused electromagnetic waves. The averaged ACS is very important in many EMC research areas such as indoor wireless channel modelling and human safety exposure study. The measurement of averaged ACS in a reverberation chamber can be achieved by measuring the rate of power loss in the time domain, however this technique requires dense frequency sampling for taking the inverse Fourier transform, which is very time consuming. A new scenario which accelerates the measurement speed is presented in this paper. It combines the technique of non-linear curve fitting to the power delay profile, segmented frequency sweeping and continuous mode stirring. The scenario was validated by measuring the averaged ACS of a hollow plastic sphere filled with deionized water in an EMC reverberation chamber. Measurement results showed a good accordance with the simulations and the measurement uncertainty was studied numerically with the Monte Carlo method.</p>

    <p>The reverberation chamber time constant quantifies how fast a reverberation chamber loses its stored energy at different frequencies, which makes it a very important parameter in many power related tests, such as the measurement of antenna efficiency, the measurement of absorption cross section, and the electromagnetic immunity test of electronic devices. The chamber time constant is usually obtained by doing regressions of power delay profile and calculating its gradient. But the shape of power delay profile can sometimes be distorted by the band limited window function applied in the frequency domain. A non-linear curve fitting technique which can cancel the effect of window function was developed, aiming to give a robust determination of the chamber time constant. With the help of this technique, window functions with much smaller bandwidth can be applied without introducing error in the evaluation of chamber time constant. In this paper, a 1 MHz wide window function in which only 10 samples of S21 are available was put under test and it was found a robust answer of chamber time constant can still be given by non-linear curve fitting techniques. Therefore the measurement time can be reduced and the frequency resolution of the chamber time constant can be increased at the same time.</p>

    <p>The plane-wave shielding effectiveness of conductive non-woven fabrics is dominated by the sheet conductance over a wide range of frequencies until the effects of skin depth, and apertures start to influence the performance (typically at 1-10 GHz depending on the areal density). This paper describes models for determining the sheet conductance from knowledge of the type, quantity, orientation and contact resistance of the fibres in the fabricated material. The stochastic nature of these materials, their complexity and local scale variability has been included in the models and correlates well with experimental results. The anisotropic sheet conductance is modelled to within 1% of the measured value in the high shielding orientation and to within 2% in the orthogonal orientation using an inter-fibre contact resistance estimated to be 10 kΩ.</p>

    <p>A novel design for a dual mode antenna, intended for use in reverberation chambers, is evaluated numerically using method-of-moments simulations. The transition region between a low frequency monopole mode and a high frequency exponential taper mode in the band 200 MHz to 1 GHz is investigated and the basic design of the antenna is shown to be near optimal for a lower operational frequency of 200 MHz. Lower frequencies can be achieved by introducing top loading without increasing the effective volume of the antenna.</p>

    <p>The interiors of mass transit vehicles act as pseudo-reverberant environments which are loaded by the bodies of passengers. This study models the broadband loading characteristics of the human body, first by simulation with spherical approximations, then by measurement of nine human subjects in a reverberation chamber. The absorption cross-section of the subjects is calculated from the loaded and unloaded transmission coefficients, and compared to the models and additionally to full-wave simulations conducted during research into human exposure. It is found to vary depending on the physical characteristics of the individual subject, with reliance on each individual characteristic being frequency-dependent. Sources of systematic error are identified and further refinements to the measurement and calculation are suggested.</p>

    <p>In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to build macro models of small structures, such as joints and apertures, for use in large-scale computer simulations for aircraft electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing and certification. The field penetrating the structure is approximated by radiated fields of electric and magnetic dipole moment array. A GA is applied to determine the dipole moment array that produces the same effect as the structure that is to be built into the model. A scanning frame and a magnetic field probe have been constructed to measure the fields in the vicinity of the small structure, to provide field data for the fitting process.</p>

    <p>The statistics of the re-radiated spectrum from two correlated non-linear devices are investigated in a reverberation chamber. The distribution of the mean- value-normalized statistics is interpreted using a double-Weibull statistical model. Comparisons are made with the re-radiation spectrum of a single non-linear device showing the statistical distributions to be different. Furthermore, experiments indicate the spatial correlation between the two non-linear devices changes the statistical distributions. This work enhances the understanding about the statistical aspects of the re-radiated spectrum from complex digital equipment.</p>

    <p>This paper details development of human body models for use in simulations for EMC certification and testing of aircraft. Current models are reviewed and their unsuitabilities for the task in hand are highlighted, which chiefly arise from inappropriate levels of complexity resulting in unfeasible computational loads. Tissue layering close to the body’s surface is investigated, as are the frequency-dependent properties of the relevant tissues, to give a model of human interaction with EM fields over a broadband frequency range. For a preliminary model, lossy dielectric spheres are simulated loading a cavity, and results are compared. These are found to be inadequate and a new model is developed, using layered dielectric cylinders to give a better fit to the body’s EM characteristics while still maintaining relative simplicity compared to the anatomically correct models previously reviewed.</p>

    <p>This paper describes a methodology for the construction of macro models of small structures used in large-scale simulations for aircraft electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing and certification. The methodology aims to provide macro-model parameters using field transformation of data obtained from detailed simulation or measurement of the feature of interest. This paper concentrates on the measurement of the electromagnetic behavior of features. A novel, absorber box, measurement technique for slots and joints is described and results are presented for measured field distribution in the vicinity of simple slots and gaps. Computer simulations are also shown as comparison to the measurement results.</p>

    <p>The statistical characteristics of re-radiated spectra of a simulated digital equipment-under-test under radio frequency interference in a reverberation chamber are studied. Statistical models of linear coupling and reradiating channels in a reverberating environment together with nonlinearities of the equipment scattering properties are synthesized into an overall analytical model of the overall probability distribution. The fit between theoretical predictions and measurement results is verified. This technique allows tracking of the statistics of re-radiated spectra and comparison between results under different RF interference levels. It may be possible to utilize these statistics for new diagnostic tools based on reverberation test standards e.g. IEC 61000-4-21.</p>

    <p>A method for measuring the shielding effectiveness of planar anisotropic materials using a rectangular waveguide cell is proposed. Computational models are used to verify the behaviour of the cell and validate its ability to measure shielding effectiveness. Results of measurements on a control sample and three carbon-fibre composite laminates in a GTEM cell are presented. A dynamic range of 70 dB with a capability to discriminate 20 dB of anisotropy is achieved in the frequency range 400-1600 MHz using cubic cells of side length 200 mm and 300 mm.</p>

    <p>In this paper we present an exposure assessment for a low profile distributed antenna fitted within an archway for a walk-through counter surveillance application. A numerical electromagnetic model, based on the method-of-moments, is used to develop a simple distributed structure antenna with optimum return loss factor in the frequency band of interest. An exposure assessment is then made using the FDTD method to determine the full-body and local specific absorption rate. The results are validated indirectly using measurements on representative systems.</p>

    <p>This paper describes the underlying statistics of the field in nested frequency-stirred reverberation chambers. The hypothesis of the probability distribution function (PDF) of a component of the frequency-stirred electric field (E_Rec) is provided and then examined by a number of goodness of fit tests. The results show that for an electrically large enclosure nested in a larger reverberation chamber, the PDF of the internal electric field E_Rec will evolve from Rayleigh to double Rayleigh with the shrinking size of the interconnection apertures. This has implications for immunity measurements of electronic systems housed in shielding enclosures.</p>

    <p>A novel indirect measurement technique is developed in which the impedance of an unknown antenna structure is determined by measuring the change in the impedance of a second probe antenna while the unknown antenna is loaded by different  known impedances. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated using method-of-moments simulations of the interaction between two dipole antennas in free space. The simulation results are supported by measurement on two dipole antennas. Applications to the measurement of the radiation impedance at the interface of a box and cable system are also presented.</p>

    <p>The indirect two-port reflection method for measuring antenna impedances is reviewed using scattering parameter techniques and developed into a more accurate low perturbation optically coupled transmission measurement. This transmission measurement infers the antenna impedance by measuring the voltage induced in a number of loads connected to the antenna port with reference to the antenna used for illumination. Both these techniques have proved to be very versatile: applications to a typically electromagnetic compatibility problem, consisting of a box and wire above a ground plane, and to the design of a challenging multi-band Digital Audio Broadcast antenna are presented.</p>

    <p>The material presented here outlines a study to determine the level of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) associated with the use of Hands Free Kit’s (HFK’s) with GSM mobile telephones and to identify the factors that influence these levels. A novel current probe was designed to measure the current profile along the HFK cables. Measurements of the HFK current were made on human subjects in an anechoic chamber and in the presence of a phantom head used for SAR measurements – good agreement was found. The SAR level was measured for both the phones and phones with HFK’s and the comparative data is presented. The factors that influence the observed level of SAR when using a HFK have been identified and their relative importance determined.</p>

    <p>Abstract: There has been concern that the cumulative emissions from the deployment of broadband Unstructured Telecommunication Transmission Networks (UTTNs) may cause interference to maritime and aeronautical radio services in the MF and HF bands. A preliminary estimation of the potential of such interference has been undertaken, based on a distributed three-dimensional model of a large city. The results show that a definitive assessment of the risk cannot be made in many cases due to the uncertainty in the key radiative characteristics of the UTTNs. Comprehensive measurements of the statistical properties of the installed based of UTTN systems are therefore needed.</p>

    <p>Emerging radio communication technologies such as UMTS will require the introduction of more flexible radio-frequency exposure assessment models and measurement protocols. This is primarily due to the different types of terminal and modes of use that will accompany the introduction of third generation systems. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of the technical parameters of UMTS, outlining the issue pertinent to exposure assessment, and present initial estimates of exposure levels based on a simple FDTD model. The results suggest such that handheld UTRA terminals are capable of satisfying the ICNIRP public exposure restrictions.</p>

    <p>Intermediate level circuit models are a very fast and frequently accurate way of modelling the electromagnetic coupling in a range of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems involving shielded enclosures. Typical models run in a few seconds on a personal computer, compared to many hours, or even days, required for full-wave simulations of the same problem. At the same time the accuracy obtained can be comparable, or even superior to full-wave techniques. The intermediate level models achieve this efficiency by utilising the known structure of the fields inside the enclosure and only modelling the dominant coupling mechanisms for a particular problem. While the origins of the intermediate level circuit model technique lie in the established waveguide circuit theory our current work is attempting to extend the method towards something that approaches a general analysis tool for relatively complex structures.</p>

    <p>Intermediate level circuit models are a very fast and frequently accurate way of modelling the electromagnetic coupling to enclosures. The technique has been extended to enclosures with a circular-cross section and a small aperture coupling model has been developed, based on aperture polarisability theory. The model is validated using measurements on a simplified version of the generic missile (GENEC), demonstrating that circuit models can reproduce most of the features seen in the measured couplings at frequencies up to 3 GHz. The models run in time scales of the order of seconds/minutes compared to the days/weeks required by full-wave solvers.</p>

    <p>Standard electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) immunity tests rely on the observed malfunction of the Equipment-under-Test (EUT) in order to define failure criteria. Such immunity tests cannot directly provide information about how close an EUT is to failure, which subsystems are being interfered with, or if error correction techniques are been exercised to mask the effects of the interference. The emission spectrum of digital hardware under the influence of an external threat field contains information about the interaction of the threat energy with the digital signals in the system that may be able to provide insight in such susceptibility characteristics of the EUT. We present measurements showing how the characteristics of the re-emission spectrum from a simple circuit may be correlated with variations in the timings of logic transitions within the circuit. This provides a direct link between the re-emission spectrum and dynamic failures in digital hardware. The technique is also applied to a complex EUT demonstrating how the re-emission spectrum may form the basis of an immunity measurement or diagnostic technique for digital equipment.</p>

    <p>The deployment of broadband data access technologies over the existing metallic telephone and mains power networks will cause unintentional RF emissions. These emissions may adversely affect the established radio noise floor. This paper considers the potential effect on the radio noise floor of the cumulative propagation of emissions from many such sources. The technologies considered are PLT (Power Line Telecommunication), ADSL (Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line) and VDSL (Very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line). Cumulative source models are developed and both ground-wave and sky-wave propagation are performed with standard packages based on ITU recommendations. Conclusions are drawn on the likely increases in radio noise floor due to these mechanisms.</p>

    <p>The immunity of digital hardware to radio frequency interference is not adequately assessed by current EMC test methods. A technique for quantifying the immunity of digital equipment using the characteristics of the re-emission spectrum is proposed which address some of these inadequacies. The technique is demonstrated experimentally using a simple circuit and a personal computer. The results demonstrate how a susceptibility profile for digital equipment can be constructed from the re-emission spectrum and how this may be related to equipment failure.</p>

    <p>Ionospheric disturbances associated with adverse space weather events introduce perturbations on trans-ionospheric radio signals that translate into fluctuations of signal intensity and phase, known as scintillation. In general, the morphology of the background ionosphere is well understood. Large-scale ionisation structures in the ionosphere (typically associated with plasma instability mechanisms) cascade into smaller scale structures. It is the presence of these small-scale irregularities that introduces scintillation on radio signals. Scintillation occurs at high latitudes (both auroral and polar regions) due to geomagnetic storms and sub-storms during disturbed geomagnetic and solar conditions as well as at low latitudes due to plasma instabilities linked to the equatorial anomaly. Although the nature of individual ionospheric irregularities and their propagation effects are mostly understood on a case-by-case basis, the understanding of the real impact of space-weather on terrestrial and aerospace infrastructure still is a challenge. Scintillation can simultaneously affect both satellite based navigation and telecommunications on a daily basis and therefore can cause serious problems for infrastructure reliant on either, or both, technologies (e.g. safety-critical applications like autonomous navigation and civil aviation as well as applications such as management of power grids crises, rail services, maritime transport, financial operations). It is important to characterise the impact of adverse space weather vulnerabilities on present and emerging technologies relying upon satellite navigation and also telecommunications. Here, we will show how global space weather impacts vary both spatially and temporally. This has important consequences for the interdependencies between systems which are affected by space weather and give insights on how resilience of infrastructure to adverse space weather events can be developed.</p>

    <p>Body composition measurements play an important role in nutritional studies, renal medicine and sports science, while human exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) is an area of growing concern owing to the implementation of Directive 2013/35/EU on EMF.  Resonant cavity techniques offer an attractive alternative to traditional methods in these fields, as they allow rapid, non-invasive measurements without using ionising radiation. At frequencies of a few tens of MHz, a large screened room can act as a cavity resonator.  A human subject inside the room perturbs its low-order resonances, and the resulting shift in frequency depends on the tissue dielectric properties, which correlate strongly with water content.  This approach has been well tested and shows good agreement with current methods of measuring total body water. The number of resonant modes increases rapidly with frequency, so if we instead use microwaves at 1GHz and above, many modes can be excited simultaneously.  Adding a rotating paddle to the room creates a ‘stirred mode’ environment, where the body is effectively illuminated by microwave radiation from all directions.  For EMF exposure studies this a more realistic scenario than considering only a single direction and polarisation.  The average absorption cross section (ACS), which is closely related to specific absorption rate (SAR), can be rapidly obtained over a very broad band (1GHz to 15GHz and beyond), whereas the alternative is detailed computer simulations that take many hours for just a single frequency. At these microwave frequencies, the field penetration into tissues is a few cm, so the ACS gives useful information about the composition of tissues near the body surface.  Normalising the ACS to body surface area gives us an ‘absorption efficiency’ that is independent of body size.  Results will be presented of the relationship between this parameter and the thickness of subcutaneous body fat. Both techniques are comfortable for the subject, use safe levels (around 1mW) of non-ionising radiation, and allow measurements to be made in less than 10min.</p>

    <p>Staircasing of surfaces is a known and well documented source of error in FDTD models on orthogonal structured meshes; however, very little work focuses on such errors in simulations of electromagnetic cavities. This work examines the different errors that arise as a direct result of using an orthogonal approximation of a hollow spherical shell. The spherical shell used has a radius of 1 m and is constructed of a simple material with a conductivity σ = 1000 S/m and a thickness h = 1 mm. This material was represented using a thin boundary SIBC model allowing a mesh size much larger than the thickness of the material. The orthogonally meshed sphere was illuminated using a planewave and the electric field measured at the centre allowing the shielding effectiveness (SE) to be calculated.</p>

    <p>An extensive experimental campaign was conducted during the project aimed to fine tune the simulation models or to validate the accuracy of the adopted approximations in the calculation of the simplified transfer functions. Characteristic components and systems of CIs, like TETRA base stations or cable raceways, are investigated according to transfer functions and susceptibility thresholds. These results are the basis for simulation and the concluding assessment of the CIs resilience against IEMI attacks.</p>

  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>This report summarises the progress to date of work funded by the University of York, Research Priming Fund, on “Electromagnetic properties of nanostructured materials”.
The inclusion of nanoscale structures within materials has the potential to provide enhanced or customised electromagnetic properties. Applications include: shielding of sensitive systems from electromagnetic radiation (e.g. as widely used in the electronics and aerospace industries) and the ability to allow some radio signals to pass whilst preventing others (e.g. privacy and security applications). The work has allowed the Physical Layer Research Group to develop its measurement capability so that the electromagnetic properties of nanostructured materials can be measured and also to begin working on materials by fabricating a range of nano-particle based films. In Section 2 a review of the electromagnetic properties of materials and the extraction of electromagnetic parameters from various measurements is discussed. The software developed for
parameter extraction is then summarised. In Section 3 the design and testing of a coaxial shielding measurement jig is described. In Section 4 the potential nano-structured materials that could be fabricated to address currently funded research application areas are identified . Section 5 provides some concluding remarks and describes future and ongoing work in this area.</p>

    <p>Recent developments in broadband data access methods over existing telephone or mains wiring will cause unintentional RF emissions which may adversely affect the
established radio noise floor. This report considers the effects due to cumulative propagation of many such sources on the established radio noise floor. It does not
consider possible interference due to near field effects. The propagation mechanisms considered are groundwave and skywave.</p>
